            <h3>Forming through Communion</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>You are what you worship. We are formed by our worship whether we are aware and 
                intentional or not. As humans we were made to love, worship, and work with God, 
                but sin broke that plan. Now we worship many things. What draws our attention, 
                affection, and allegiance is what we are worshiping. Our worship will be 
                intentionally focused on God, and practiced in an expectational way that when 
                we gather to worship, God will meet us and transform us by his grace, love and 
                mercy. God loves us the way we are, but loves us too much to let us stay there, 
                so he is committed to transformation of our heads, our hearts, and our hands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="nav-item"><span class="value">Prayer:</span> Learning to have conversation with God is critical to our relationship
                    with God together. Whenever we gather as a community, talking with God, 
                    listening to him, and praising him will inform how we gather. (Psalm 134)</li>
                <li><span class="value">Gospel centered:</span> God’s redemptive story begins in Genesis and runs to 
                    Revelation. God is always on mission to save that which is lost and renew that
                    which is broken. This grace informs our worship, our preaching, our teaching, 
                    our fellowship, our mission, and our lives.  Jesus’ life, death, resurrection, 
                    ascension, and return is the apex of redemptive history, so our understanding 
                    of the Old and New Testament is understood through this lens. Our engagement 
                    of our culture and participation in daily life, must also flow through the 
                    lens of the Gospel. (Romans 1:1-6)</li>
                <li><span class="value">Sacramental:</span> Jesus gave two normative practices for his people; baptism and 
                    communion. They are the practice of the life of the church. It is normative 
                    that those who become followers of Jesus are baptized and then as a community 
                    we share communion with Christ and his people. This practice shapes us and 
                    forms us. (Matthew 28:18-20, Luke 22:19-20)</li>
                <li><span class="value">Spiritual disciplines:</span> A discipline is an activity or experience that provides
                    mental or physical training. Spiritual disciplines provide spiritual training. 
                    The Church has struggled with misplacing and misusing disciplines and as a 
                    result, many have forsaken them or fail to see their benefit. Christian 
                    disciplines like fasting, silence and solitude, meditation, Lectio, sabbath, 
                    praying the hours and others, can help us attune our hearts to God in the 
                    business and rush of daily life. No discipline makes God love us, but 
                    disciplines can help us know the love of God more. (Matthew 6)</li>
                <li><span class="value">Training:</span> A disciple in the New Testament meant “student.” When Jesus gives 
                    the great commission in Matthew 28, there is a significant training component. 
                    As students, we are to learn, but not just gain information, rather put into 
                    practice what the scriptures say. Additionally developing ourselves in our 
                    gifting and in ministry skills such as sharing the gospel, or practicing 
                    hospitality are skills that every Christian can develop and grow. Our posture 
                    as a community is to be a learning, developing fellowship that values the 
                    heart, the head, and the hands and we will learn together to do so. 
                    (James 1:22-25)</li>
